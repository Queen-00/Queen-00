- ðŸ‘‹ Heya, Iâ€™m @Queen-00
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in discord bot development, AI, graphic design, 3D modeling, Photoshop, web design...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about AI in regards to its application in discord bots without using an AI service...
- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with discord devs familiar in JavaScript & Python...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - dc @xspliff_queenx or gypsyqueend00@gmail.com...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her or whatever its not something i really care about so much...
- âš¡ Fun fact: currently working on 2 applications for discord, growing a business, my favorite language is probably javascript due to it being a beginner friendly language allowing me to work with more devs its usually one of the first people learn & while i love dev work I'm primarily an editor which is my main passion of the two surprisingly...

â†’ this is a brand new acc i made to join a new team for my company, i didn't want to link my personal freelance acc. i will not have personal repos or anything connected to this acc more than likely. i do not share my applications repos at the current time as we plan to publish them with premiums to help support the applications. 
i have a hectic schedule & very unpredictable availability however when i do have time im always interested in collaborations or freelance for both dev & editorial work.
